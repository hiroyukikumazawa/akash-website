- Remove the static/dynamic question during the initial boot as it may confuse users.
- Show nodes in the cluster on the Dashboard with `kubectl get nodes -A -o wide`.
- Allow adding a new node to the cluster with just an IP address.
- Remove the question for adding a node to the cluster for the original IP; all add/remove operations should happen from the Dashboard only.
- Update `run-helm-k3s` to use functions so each can be called separately.
- Update the bid-engine script with the latest version.
- Add/Remove Attributes from Dashboard and default GPU, etc.
